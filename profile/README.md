## About Zight
Zight (formerly CloudApp) is a comprehensive visual communication platform designed to help teams collaborate more effectively through screenshots, screen recordings, and annotated visual content. This powerful tool streamlines how teams share information by replacing lengthy email explanations with quick visual demonstrations that are instantly shareable via short links. Available for both Windows and macOS, Zight combines intuitive screen capture capabilities with robust cloud storage and collaboration features, making it an essential tool for customer support, software development, design teams, remote work, and any scenario where visual communication enhances understanding and efficiency.

The platform excels in its simplicity and speed—users can capture their screen, webcam, or specific application windows with keyboard shortcuts, then immediately receive a shareable link that's automatically copied to their clipboard. Zight's annotation tools allow users to add clarity to their captures with arrows, text, blur effects, and highlights before sharing. For more complex explanations, the screen recording feature enables users to create quick video tutorials, bug reports, or product demos with both system audio and microphone narration. The enterprise-grade features include team management, custom branding, advanced security controls, and analytics that track how shared content is being viewed. With seamless integration into popular workflow tools like Slack, Jira, and Trello, Zight fits naturally into existing team processes while significantly reducing miscommunication and accelerating project timelines.
